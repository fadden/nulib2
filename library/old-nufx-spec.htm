 Preface
 -------
 
 The first copy of this proposal that was circulated was preliminary
 revision 10.   Since then I have had many requests for a more flexible
 solution to the archival problem.  To do so meant the removal of such
 features as the alignment to 128-byte boundaries of all data blocks and
 so forth, and the re-definition of the header block so that it is less rigid
 in its format (extensible).
 
 To do this makes it at least a factor more complex for programs which can
 extract records from NuFX archives on-the-fly (such as telecommunications
 programs).  While this may be seen as a hardship by some, I believe the
 additional power provided by all formats after revision 10 justifies the
 additional complexity.  Standalone utility programs should have no problems
 adjusting to the new format.
 
 This final revision of the documentation fixes the master_header's size
 at 48 bytes, eliminates the archive_create_program and archive_mod_program
 fields, increases the size of the access field to a longword, and introduces
 a new name for the archive, NFX, or NuFX, for "NuFile eXchange."
 
 I am also almost finished an archive program which places files or disks
 into NuFX archives using dynamic LZW compression, ShrinkIt.  Any reference
 to ShrinkIt in the text is a reference to this program.
 
 Final Rev 2 corrects the all the algorithms to include the length of the
 thread list in their calculations, includes some notes on how to properly
 include threads and directories, and standardizes on the use of "NuFX" to
 describe the archive name so as to distinguish it from Sun Microsystems'
 "NFS" network product.
 
 Final Rev 3 changes some of the terminology used, changes the date labels
 to xx_when instead of xxx_date_time, assigns the resource_fork of a file
 to be stored as a thread_kind in a data_thread instead of having it's own
 thread available.  An attempt at further clarity has been undertaken.

 History
 -------
 
 The Apple II community has always been sorely lacking a well-defined method
 for archiving files.  NuFX is an attempt to rectify the situation by providing
 for a flexible, consistent standard for archiving files, disks, and other
 computer medium.
 
 The Binary II standard, authored by Gary B. Little, for placing multiple files
 within a single file has been rendered obsolete by the (now) recent release of
 GS/OS(tm) which provides access to multiple filing systems.  Since GS/OS can
 (or will) use HFS files, Binary II does NOT provide for:
 
 o  filenames larger than 64 characters
    (GS/OS can create 8000 character filenames)
 
 o  a convenient way to add to, remove from, and other ways work on an archive.
 
 o  including HFS-style files which contain resource forks.
 
 o  including of entire disk images.
 
 o  including messages along with a file.
 
 o  a convenient way to represent that a file is compressed or encrypted by
     a specific application.  (an excess secondary header must be attached to
     the beginning of files, such is the case with SQueezed files)
 
 o  a true archive standard.  Binary II's original intent was to make transfer
     of Apple II files from local machines to large information services like
     The Source, Delphi, CompuServe, and GEnie, possible.  Otherwise, a file's
     attribute information would be lost.  Binary II is now being stretched
     beyond what it was originally meant to do.
 
 o  no support for multiple data threads or structures.
 
 Adding all of these features to the existing Binary II standard would not only
 be nerve-racking, but nearly impossible without violating the existing standard
 and causing a great deal of confusion (ie, "did you say it was Binary II, first
 revision or the second one?")  Although Binary II is flexible, it is simply
 unable to address all of these concerns without alienating existing Binary II
 extraction programs.
 
 So, to provide some differentiation between standards and provide a better
 functioning format, I have defined a new standard called "NuFX" (NuFile
 eXchange for the Apple II).  NuFX fixes the problems that Apple IIgs(tm)
 users would soon be experiencing as other filing systems become available for
 GS/OS(tm).  I am trying to stop a set of problems before they have a chance to
 develop.  NuFX provides all of the features of Binary II, but doesn't stop
 there...  it goes farther to allow the user the ultimate in flexibility,
 usefulness and performance.

 Implementation
 --------------
 
 The basic structure of a NuFX archive is as follows:
 
                 [First record]                    [Next Record]
 +---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
 | Master Header | Header | Data  . . . . . . . .  | Header | Data  . . . .  |
 +---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
 
 A single master header block contains values which describe the entire archive
 (those of you who are into structured programming can consider them archive
 globals).  Each of the succeeding header blocks contain only information about
 the record they precede (consider them archive locals).
 
 Each header block may be followed by a series of "threads."  Each thread may
 be a portion of data, a message, the resource part of an extended file, a
 control sequence for a NuFX utility program, or almost any sort of
 sequential data.  The number of threads is described as a longword (32-bit
 word), so it is also possible to properly archive and store the data
 portions of sparse files.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 NuFX Documentation  2/3/89                             - Page 5 -
 
 
 Master header block contents:
 
 All word and double-word values are byte-reversed.
 
 Offset  Length  Content
 ------  ------  ---------------------------------------------------------------
 +0      1       $4E  Master ID Byte #1
 +1      1       $F5  Master ID Byte #2
 +2      1       $46  Master ID Byte #3   spells the word "NuFile" in
 +3      1       $E9  Master ID Byte #4   alternating ASCII (high, low) for
 +4      1       $6C  Master ID Byte #5   uniqueness.
 +5      1       $E5  Master ID Byte #6
 
 +6      2       master_crc
 
                 16-bit CRC of the remaining fields in this block.
                 (bytes +8 through +47)
 
                 Any programs which modify the master header block *MUST*
                 recalculate the CRC for the master header.
 
 +8      4       total_records
 
                 Total number of records in this archive file.
 
                 It is possible to chain multiple records (Files or
                 Disks) together.  It is also possible to chain
                 different types of records together (Files and
                 Disks mixed).

 +12     8       archive_create_when
 
                 The date and time on which this archive was initially
                 created.  This field should never be changed once initially
                 written.
 
                 The format of this field is as follows:
 
                 +12     second - 0 through 59
                 +13     minute - 0 through 59
                 +14     hour - 0 through 23
                 +15     current Year minus 1900
                 +16     day - 0 through 30
                 +17     month - 0 through 11, with 0=January
                 +18     filler byte - reserved must be null (00).
                 +19     weekDay - 1 through 7, with 1=Sunday
 
                 The format of this field is identical to that described
                 in the _ReadTimeHex ($0D03) call described on page 14-14
                 of the Apple_IIgs_Toolbox_Reference:_Volume_1.
 
                 If the date is not known, or is unable to be calculated, this
                 field should be set to null (00).  If the weekDay is not
                 known, or is unable to be calculated, this field should be
                 set to null (00).
 
 
 +20     8       archive_mod_when
 
                 The date of the last modification to this archive. This field
                 should be changed every time a change is made to any of the
                 records in the archive.
 
                 The format of this field is as follows:
 
                 +20     second - 0 through 59
                 +21     minute - 0 through 59
                 +22     hour - 0 through 23
                 +23     current Year minus 1900
                 +24     day - 0 through 30
                 +25     month - 0 through 11, with 0=January
                 +26     filler byte - reserved, must be null (00).
                 +27     weekDay - 1 through 7, with 1=Sunday
 
                 The format of this field is identical to that described
                 in the _ReadTimeHex ($0D03) call described on page 14-14
                 of the Apple_IIgs_Toolbox_Reference:_Volume_1.
 
                 If the date is not known, or is unable to be calculated, this
                 field should be set to null (00).  If the weekDay is not
                 known, or is unable to be calculated, this field should be
                 set to null (00).

 The following header block must precede each record within the NuFX archive.
 The cyclic redundancy check (CRC) has been provided to detect archives which
 have possibly been corrupted.  The only time the CRC should be included in
 in a block is for the master header and for each of the regular header blocks.
 The CRC functions to ensure reliability and record integrity.
 
 Header Block contents:
 
 All word and double-word values are byte-reversed.
 
 Offset  Length  Content
 ------  ------  ---------------------------------------------------------------
 +0      1       $4E - Header ID Byte #1
 +1      1       $F5 - Header ID Byte #2  Spells "NuFX" in alternating ascii
 +2      1       $46 - Header ID Byte #3  (high/low) for uniqueness.
 +3      1       $D8 - Header ID Byte #4
 
 +4      2       header_crc
 
                 16-bit CRC of the remaining fields of this block.
                 (bytes 6 through the end of the attributes, filename, and
                  any threads.)
 
                 This field is used to verify the integrity of the rest of the
                 block.
 
                 Programs which make NuFX archives *MUST* include this
                 in every header.  It is up to the discretion of the extracting
                 program to check the validity of these bytes.  Any programs
                 which might modify the header of a particular record *MUST*
                 recalculate the CRC for the header block.
 
 
 +6      2       attrib_count
 
                 This field describes the length of the attribute section of each
                 header in bytes.  This count measures the distance in bytes
                 from the first field (offset +0) to and including the
                 filename_length field.  By convention, the filename_length
                 field will always be the last 2 bytes of the attribute
                 section regardless of what has preceded it.

 +8      2       version_number
 
                 Minimum NuFX version number needed for extraction.
                 (Currently $0000)
 
                 This field is used to detect the possible existence of
                 other as-of-yet undefined fields and features.  Utility
                 programs should check this value to be certain that they
                 are capable of extracting a record with this minimum version.
 
 
 +10     4       total_threads
 
                 The number of thread sub-records which should be expected
                 immediately following the end of the file/path name.  This
                 field is extremely important because it contains the
                 information about the length of the last 1/3 of the header.
 
 
 +14     2       file_sys_id
 
                 Native file system identifier:
 
                 $0000   reserved
                 $0001   ProDOS/SOS

                 Disk: if the file system of a disk is not known, then
                  this field should be set to null (0000).

 +16     2       file_sys_info
 
                 Information about the current filing system:
 
                 [$00xx]
 
                 Native file system separator.  Under Prodos, the "/" ($2F)
                 character is used to separate paths.  Under HFS, the
                 ":" ($3A) character is used to separate paths.  Under
                 MS-DOS, the "\" ($5C) character is used to separate paths.
                 The low byte of this word is used to store the file system's
                 separator.
 
                 The primary reason for including this field is that the
                 receiving file system (say, to Prodos 8 from GS/OS running an
                 HFS File System Translator) must know how to parse a valid
                 file/path name from the filename field for the receiving file
                 system.
 
                 [$xx00]
 
                 Sparse byte.  If the high-byte of this word is $01, then
                 the image which follows is a sparse file (and the threads
                 should have been filled in properly to indicate this).  If
                 a more "normal" image follows, this byte will be null (00).

                 example, under Prodos, this field will be 512, while HFS
                 would set it to 524.

 Any other attributes which are needed may be added at the discretion of the

 attrib_count-2  filename_length (xx bytes)
 
                 Length of filename.  Under Prodos, this will not exceed 64
                 characters.  If HFS or another filing system is used, this
                 field may exceed 64 characters.  This is the last field
                 considered included in the attributes section.  To allow the
                 inclusion of future additional parameters in the attributes
                 section,  NuFX utility programs should rely on the
                 attribs_count field to find the filename_length field.
 
 -------------------------
 End of attributes section
 
 
      xx Bytes   Filename or partial pathname if applicable.
 
 
 
                 If this is a disk which is being archived, then the
                 volume_name should be included in this field.  If a volume
                 name is included in this field, a separator ("/" or ":")
                 should *NOT* be included in, or precede the name.  If a volume
                 name is not available, then this field should be set to nulls.
                 (00's)
 
                 If a partial pathname is specified, the directories to which
                 the current pathname refers need not have preceded this
                 particular record.  The extraction program must test each
                 referenced directory individually.  If the directory in
                 question does not exist, the extracting program should create
                 it.
 
                 Any utility which extracts files from a NuFX archive *MUST NOT*
                 assume that this field will be in a format it is able to
                 handle.  In particular, extraction programs should check for
                 mixed case text in a file/path name and do whatever
                 conversions are necessary to parse a legal file/path name.
                 In general, assume nothing.

 Threads
 -------
 
 Thread records are 16 byte records which immediately follow the filename and
 describe the types of data structures which are included with a given record.
 The number of thread records is described in the attribute section by a
 longword, total_threads.
 
 Each thread record should be checked for the type of information that a given
 utility program can extract.  If a utility is incapable of extracting a
 particular thread, that thread should be skipped.  If a utility finds a
 redundancy in a thread_record, it must decide whether to skip the record or to
 do something with that particular thread (ie, if a utility finds 2
 message_threads it can either ignore the second thread or display it. Likewise,
 if a utility finds 2 resource threads, it can either overwrite the first thread
 which was extracted, or warn the user and skip the errant thread).
 
 
 A thread record can be represented as follows:
 
 Offset  Length  Content
 ------  ------  ---------------------------------------------------------------
 +0      2       thread_class
 +2      2       thread_format
 +4      2       thread_kind
 +6      2       reserved
 +8      4       thread_eof
 +12     4       comp_thread_eof
 
 
 "thread_class" describes the classification of the thread
 ---------------------------------------------------------
 
 $0000   =       message_thread
 $0001   =       control_thread
 $0002   =       data_thread
 $0003   =       sparse_thread
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 NuFX Documentation  2/3/89                            - Page 16 -
 
 
 "thread_format" is the format of the data within the thread.
 ------------------------------------------------------------
 
 $0000   =       Uncompressed                    [Not application specific]
 $0001   =       SQueezed (SQ/USQ)               [Not application specific]

 $0003
  .
  .      RESERVED, contact the author
  .
 
 $FFFF
 
 
 "thread_kind" describes the kind of data which is contained in the thread
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 if thread_class
    $0000   =       message_thread
                    thread_kind $0000 = ASCII text
                                $xxxx = all others undefined
 
    $0001   =       control_thread
                    thread_kind $0000 = create directory
                                $xxxx = all others undefined
 
    $0002   =       data_thread
                    thread_kind $0000 = data_fork of file
                    thread_kind $0001 = disk image
                    thread_kind $0002 = resource_fork of file
                                $xxxx = all others undefined
 
 
 "thread_eof" is the length of the uncompressed thread
 -----------------------------------------------------
 
 
 "comp_thread_eof" is the length of the compressed thread
 --------------------------------------------------------
 
 
 Current ideas for messages include static pictures, sounds, sound & pictures,
 animations, and possibly executable files.  I encourage writers of NuFX
 utility programs to be able to handle messages of the lowest common
 denominator, ASCII text.

 Finding the start of the thread list
 ------------------------------------
 
 The beginning of the thread records can be found by using the following
 algorithm:
 
 Threads := (mark at beginning of header) + (attrib_count) +
             (filename_length)
 
 
 Finding the end of the thread list
 ----------------------------------
 
 The end of the thread records can be found by applying the following
 algorithm:
 
 endOfThreads := (mark at beginning of header) + (attrib_count) +
                  (filename_length) + (16 * total_threads)
 
 
 Finding the start of a data_thread
 ----------------------------------
 
 The beginning of a data_thread can be found using the following algorithm:
 
 Data Mark := (mark at beginning of header) + (attrib_count) +
                (filename_length) + (16 * total_threads) +
                  (comp_thread_eof of all threads in the thread list which
                   are not data prior to finding a data_thread)
 
 
 Finding the start of a resource_thread
 --------------------------------------
 
 The beginning of a resource_thread can be found using the following algorithm:
 
 Resource Mark := (mark at beginning of header) + (attrib_count) +
                    (filename_length) + (16 * total_threads) +
                      (comp_thread_eof of all the threads in the thread list
                       which are not resources prior to finding a
                       resource_thread)
 
 
 Finding the next record
 -----------------------
 
 The next record can be found using the following algorithm:
 
 Next Mark := (mark at beginning of header) + (attrib_count) +
               (filename_length) + (16 * total_threads) +
                (comp_thread_eof of each thread)

 Misc notes on threads
 ---------------------
 
 There must *ALWAYS* be at least 1 thread attached to each record, whether
 the thread has any physical length or not.  Phantom files and directories will
 have both the thread_eof and comp_thread_eof fields set to null (00).
 
 If a control_thread indicates that a directory should be created on the
 destination device, the path to be created must take the form of a prodos
 partial pathname.  That is, the path must *NOT* be preceded with a volume
 name.  ie, /STUFF/SUBDIR is an invalid path, while SUBDIR/ANOTHERSUB is
 a legal path.
 
 If a control_thread indicates that a directory is to be created, *ALL*
 the subdirectories that are contained in the pathname must be created.
 
 Control_threads will be eventually used to control the execution of utility
 programs by allowing for directory creation, renaming, deleting, moving,
 or modifying files.  A form of scripting language will eventually be available
 to allow utility programs to perform these actions automatically.
 Control_threads will allow extraction programs to perform operations akin to
 Apple's GS/OS installer program, allowing updates to program sets dependent
 upon such things as date of creation or modification, version number, etc.

 Disks
 -----
 
 If the file system of a particular disk is not known, the file_sys_id field
 should be set to null, the volume name should also be set to null, and all
 the other fields pertaining only to files should be set to null.
 
 If the file system of a particular disk *IS* known, as many of the fields
 as possible should be filled with the correct information.  Fields which do not
 pertain to an archived disk should remain set to null.
 
 If an entire disk is added to the archive without some form of compression
 (ie, record_format = uncompressed), then the blocks which comprise the disk
 image *MUST* be added sequentially from the first through the last block.
 Since there will be no character included in the data stream to mark the
 end/beginning of a block, extraction programs should rely on the
 file_sys_block_size field to determine how many bytes to read from the record
 to properly fill a block.

 Directories
 -----------
 
 Directories are handled almost the same way that normal files are handled with
 the exception that there will be no data in the thread which follows the entry.
 A thread_record *MUST* exist to inform a utility that a directory is to be
 created through the use of the proper control_thread value.
 
 Directories do not necessarily have to precede a record which references a
 directory.  ie, if a record contains STUFF/MY.STUFF, the directory "STUFF"
 need not exist for the extracting program to properly extract the record.  The
 extracting program must check to see if each of the directories referenced
 exist, and if they do not exist, create them.  While this method places a great
 burden on the abilities of the extraction program, it avoids the anomalies
 associated with the deletion of directories within an archive.

 Cyclic Redundancy Checks (CRC's)
 --------------------------------
 
 Many people are not aware of how to calculate a CRC, so to provide this
 function, I am providing source code to a very fast routine which does the crc
 calculation.  The routine "makeLookup" needs to be called only once.  After
 this, the routine "doByte" should be called repeatedly with each new byte in
 succession to generate the cumulative CRC for the block.  The CRC word should
 be reset to null (0000) before beginning each new CRC.
 
 This is the same CRC calculation which is done for CRC/Xmodem, and Ymodem.  The
 code is easily portable to a 16-bit environment like the Apple IIgs.  The only
 detrimental factor with this routine is that it requires 512 bytes of main
 memory to operate.  If you can spare the space, this is one of the fastest
 routines I know to generate a CRC-16 on a 6502-type machine.
